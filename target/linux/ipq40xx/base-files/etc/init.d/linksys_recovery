# This script resets the boot counter and set the auto_recovery to 'yes'. This is not needed for stable relases. You
# should keep this in all developer snapshots.
# Linksys do enable the auto_recovery and set the boot counter to 0 during a firmware upgrade and this is also true for
# a sysupgrade. When doing a stable release, please: remove this code and don't use the auto_recovery feature.
# Note: if the device fails to set the boot couter to 0 while the auto_recovery feature is on, the device WILL reboot
# to the other partition at the 3rd boot.
